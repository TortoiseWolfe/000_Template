## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: security@example.com

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported releases
4. Release patches as soon as possible

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong, industry-standard authentication mechanisms
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure password policies (minimum 12 characters)
- Implement account lockout mechanisms
- Use multi-factor authentication where possible

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follow the principle of least privilege

#### Secure Coding
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use security linters and static analysis tools
- Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper logging without sensitive data

#### API Security
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all API inputs
- Use proper CORS configuration
- Implement API versioning

### For Users

#### Installation Security
1. Always verify package integrity
2. Use official sources for downloads
3. Keep the application updated
4. Review dependency licenses

#### Configuration Security
1. Change all default passwords
2. Use strong, unique passwords
3. Enable all available security features
4. Regularly review access logs
5. Implement network segmentation

#### Operational Security
1. Regular security audits
2. Monitor for suspicious activity
3. Implement backup strategies
4. Test disaster recovery procedures
5. Train staff on security awareness
